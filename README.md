# mice, messing with dice

This is a simple crate for evaluating dice expressions.
It will receive features as I desire, or as are contributed
if I happen to be so lucky.

I am rather new to Rust, so I imagine some things in here are
messier than they could be. I don't expect guidance, but
please tell me if something in here irks you.
