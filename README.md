[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Monadic-Cat/mbot.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Monadic-Cat/mbot)

# mbot, mice bot I guess
This is a discord bot for personal usage- it will accrue features
as I want them.

# Building
This project builds like any Cargo binary crate.
Use the Cargo build commands.

# Running
Set the environment variable `MBOT_TOKEN` to the bot token you're using,
then run it like any Cargo binary.

You may also set the `INSTANCE_MESSAGE_PREFIX` environment variable,
which will add the given prefix to all replies the bot sends.
I may change that variable name sometime,
probably to something like `MBOT_INSTANCE_MESSAGE_PREFIX`.
