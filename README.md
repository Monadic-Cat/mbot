# mice, messing with dice

This is a simple crate for evaluating dice expressions.
It will receive features as I desire, or as are contributed
if I happen to be so lucky.

Panicking from this crate is considered a serious bug.
Please  submit an Issue on this project's GitHub repo
if it manages to do that, and please describe the usage
that it panicked from.
